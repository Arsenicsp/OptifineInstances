# Optifine instances for MultiMC

## Changing Minecraft Versions
If you want to change the Minecraft version, change the branch
to the desired version. If the version you want isn't there, [Optifine](https://optifine.net/)
probably hasn't been released yet.

## Usage

### Installing a New Instance
To install a new instance, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/MMCInstances/OptifineInstances/releases) and select the optifine version you want to use. Download or copy the link to the zip for the version you want (e.g. 1.14.4.zip). You can then import the zip file in MultiMC to create an instance with OptiFine.

### Upgrading a Previous Instance
With each release since 1.14.4 F3 pre2, a patch zip will be included. This only includes the mmc-pack.json, libraries folder, and patch folder. You can download this zip file and extract it to your instance folder. Your instances `.minecraft` folder, pack icon, and instance config will not be removed or changed.
